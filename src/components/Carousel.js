During the design phase, my work included meeting with the client to collect technical specifications, wireframe design, mock-up testing with target users, and UI design. During development, I implemented the tagging system, tag and keyword search, and worked with a teammate to integrate the larger search bar. In addition, I worked on the nonprofit side of the website, and set up component testing, running numerous unit-tests with Enzyme and Jest. Check out the project with sample data above!",
