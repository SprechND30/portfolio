      Hi! I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and minors in Mathematics and Data Science from Grove City College. I greatly enjoy taking on challenging projects, and, as such, my most valuable experiences have been ones that force me to adapt to new circumstances, tools, or ways of thinking. I always love tackling hard problems, but more than that, I love learning new ways of approaching them.
